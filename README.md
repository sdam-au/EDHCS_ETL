## Abstract
Social development is often measured through increasing social stratification and economic specialisation through time. According to Adam Smith (1776/2007), growing population size leads to greater specialisation of labour as well as the proliferation of social roles. However true for modern society, this theory has been applied to the ancient world only to a limited extent (Bowman and Wilson 2009; Hanson, Ortman, and Lobo 2017), mostly due to the problematic access to comparable and relevant longitudinal datasets.

Inscriptions on permanent media have been produced by most communities of the ancient Meditteranean, providing a proxy for the population that created them. The texts of inscriptions mention not only the names of individuals, but also their occupation and craft and trade associations that we can locate in space and time. The number as well as the content of the inscriptions thus let us evaluate the relation between the degree of economic specialization and the estimated size of the urban population in ancient Mediterranean. 

Given that Smith's law operates on the density of population, we will test its core assumptions by comparing the variation in social and economic differentiation expressed in epigraphic monuments between rural and urban areas. The expectation (null hypothesis) is that the functional range of inscriptions (represented by inscription types) and economic specialization within the inscription content will increase with higher density of population (closer towards urban centers). 

The aggregated epigraphic dataset [Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss Slaby](http://www.manfredclauss.de/) contains over 500,000 inscriptions, covering the Latin epigraphic production distributed equally across the ancient Mediterranean and spanning a period of 1000 years.  

This study contributes to the debate on the role of urbanism in ancient Mediterranean by using large-scale but highly granular data as proxies for economic and social development. The study aims to set an example by following FAIR data principles and best practices in reproducible open research.
